# Challenge 4

## Web APIs: Code Quiz

This challenge required me to make a multiple choice coding quiz.  When the start button is clicked, a timer is started from 75 seconds. Ten seconds are subtracted from the clock if the answer is incorrect.  The final time is the score and when the game is over, the use can input their initials and save to the high score board.
